### PDF Handler

- Utility for handling pdf files for offline access
- Born out of necessity after facing issues with personal documents for administrative purposes when no net access was
  available
- CLI interface
- Most used PDF operations were given priority
    - combine/merge
    - delete pages
    - rearrange based on the given order of pages
    - compress pdf (compression can be adjusted)
    - image quality reduction of images in a pdf (compression can be controlled)
- Plan to expand further (with Django project) - GUI (as part of a web app, currently ongoing)
